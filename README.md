# Coding Challenge

## Mars Rover

### Running the application
This solution runs in Python 3.9 and needs no further third-party libraries.

##### Start a new mission
To start a mission, run main.py and paste or type the mission input into the console. 

The input is expected to be in a very particular shape, as given in the assignment.
You may use input_example.txt. It is important to conclude the instructions with a newline (or 'ENTER' or 'f').

### Running tests
Run ```python -m unittest mars_rover_mission_tests.test_plateau.TestPlateau``` in /MarsRoverCodingChallenge/
